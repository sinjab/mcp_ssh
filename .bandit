# Bandit configuration file for MCP SSH
# This project is specifically designed for SSH automation, so some security warnings are expected

skips:
  - B507  # ssh_no_host_key_verification - We use AutoAddPolicy for SSH connections, which is necessary for automation
  - B601  # paramiko_calls - We use paramiko exec_command, which is the purpose of this tool

# Note: B108 (hardcoded_tmp_directory) has been fixed by using tempfile.gettempdir()
